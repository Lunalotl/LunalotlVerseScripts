Ultra-Customizable script for Battle Royale Styled floor loot in UEFN. Setup tutorial on [my Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/@lunalotlyt).
IMPORTANT: Due to limitations, only 100 items can be spawned at once, so I'd recommend setting the "SpawnChances" to something other than Guaranteed.
If using this, please make sure to credit me (preferably by linking my Twitter/X account). Please do not claim this is your own script / alter and pass it off as your own.
